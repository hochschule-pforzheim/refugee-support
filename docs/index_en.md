# Entry

  1. **Which documents do I need to enter the country?** <br>
      Biometric passport or Schengen visa.

  2. **How long can I stay?**<br> Refugees from Ukraine are granted temporary protection based on the EU Directive on so-called mass influx (Directive 2001/55/EC) in accordance with § 24 of the Residence Act (AufenthG).

  3. **Do I have to quarantine due to Corona?**<br> Ukraine is no longer classified as a high-risk area (as of February 27, 2022). Thus, there is only a general obligation to test before entry, but no longer a quarantine and registration requirement. The federal police will deal pragmatically with the situation of war refugees and displaced persons. Among other things, voluntary tests are offered upon entry at the border. In case of Covid symptoms, medical professionals should be consulted.

  4. **Do I have to apply for asylum?** <br>No! Refugees from Ukraine do not have to go through an asylum procedure. An asylum application is not required. The admission of Ukrainian nationals can take place on the basis of the so-called directive on temporary protection in all EU member states for the reception of war refugees. The right to apply for asylum also remains. To whom does this information apply to?<br><br>
  <ul>   
    <li>Ukrainian nationals who stayed in Ukraine before February 24, 2022</li>
    <li>Stateless persons and nationals of third countries other than Ukraine who enjoyed 
      international protection or equivalent national protection in Ukraine before 24 February 2022</li>
    <li>Family members of the first two groups of persons mentioned, even if they are not    
      Ukrainian nationals</li>
    <li>and for stateless persons and nationals of third countries other than Ukraine who 
      an prove that they were legally resident in Ukraine before 24 February 2022 based on a valid permanent residence permit issued under Ukrainian law and who are unable to return safely and permanently to their country of origin or region of origin.</li>
  </ul>  

# Living & Accomodation 

  5. **Where can I stay?**  
     If you have a valid visa or biometric passport and you can initially pay for your care yourself, the nearest immigration authorities or police stations will usually only record your data. You can then choose your accommodation freely. In addition, many cities also have central contact points that you can contact..

  6.  **What if I do not know where to stay?** <br>
  Please contact the nearest immigration office or police station if
  -  you do not have a valid visa or biometric passport with which you can prove a legal stay in Germany, 
  - or you have no financial means for your own care.  
  Police is typically also present at all major train stations. They can help in registration and provide help to find accommodation and food. The nearest responsible immigration authority can be found [here](https://bamf-navi.bamf.de/de/Themen/Behoerden/).

# Work & School

7.  **Can I work in Germany?**<br>With the EU directive on mass influx, Ukrainians receive a legal residence status with which a work permit is to be automatically issued. Currently, it is  unclear how integration into the system of the federal employment agency (e.g., attendance of integration courses in preparation for employment) will be handled.

8.  **Can my child go to school?**<br>This depends on the federal state. All countries are currently preparing a quick and uncomplicated admission of Ukrainian children to school.

# Emergencies & Health Care

9.  **Which emergency numbers are there?**

    -   **Police**: 110

    -   **Ambulance** and **fire brigade**: 112

    -   **General medical service**: 116117

10. **Do I have health insurance?**<br>We were able to find out the following through the information page of the health [insurance companies](https://www.krankenkassenzentrale.de/wiki/fluechtlinge):

    -   Medical treatment is carried out in the first 15 months according to § 4 Abs. 1
        AsylbLG only in the case of acute and acute treatment-requiring illnesses, pain, pregnancy, vaccinations and preventive examinations. According to §6.1 AsylbLG, "benefits may be granted in particular if, in individual cases, they are used to secure \[...\] of health are indispensable...".
    -   Refugees who have been living in Germany for more than 15 months are entitled to 
        benefits in accordance with the social law (XII), which regulates social assistance.

        offices)
